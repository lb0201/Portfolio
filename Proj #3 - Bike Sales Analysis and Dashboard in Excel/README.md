## Project Title

Bike Sales Analysis and Dashboard in Excel

## Description

This Excel Project involves an extensive analysis of bike sales data with a focus on understanding various aspects of the dataset. The project is organized into the following phases:

## Key Features

1. **Data Setup and Cleaning**: The initial phase entails setting up the dataset for analysis and ensuring data integrity. Data cleaning is performed to address inconsistencies, missing values, and any errors, creating a robust foundation for analysis. I've employed the "Remove Duplicates" feature to eliminate redundant data entries and utilized the "Find and Replace" function to modify easily confused acronyms. I've also implemented data standardization through functions such as "Proper", "Trim", and "Number Format" and generated Age data values via a Nested IF formula to establish an Age Bracket column, facilitating Age-related data analysis. 
2. **Pivot Tables Creation**: To extract meaningful insights, pivot tables have been created. These dynamic data summaries allow for the exploration of different dimensions, such as income, gender, miles-ridden, and life stages. The pivot tables provide a structured view of the data, making it easier to draw conclusions. I've developed Pivot Tables categorizing data by gender, distance, and age for in-depth analysis and chart creation.
3. **Dashboard Development**: A user-friendly and interactive dashboard was designed to visualize the bike sales dataset's key findings. The dashboard utilizes charts, graphs, and summary statistics to present the data in a clear and intuitive manner, enabling stakeholders to grasp the information at a glance.
   <br/> **Filter Buttons Integration**: The project includes filter buttons to the dashboard, enhancing user interactivity. These buttons allow users to customize their view of the data by applying filters based on various criteria, making it easier to focus on specific aspects of the dataset.
